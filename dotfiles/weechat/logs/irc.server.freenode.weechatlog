2020-02-12 21:25:14	--	- in 1951, he followed up with novels, short stories, plays,
2020-02-12 21:25:14	--	- essays, articles and screenplays. His probably most popular
2020-02-12 21:25:14	--	- work is the novel 'King Stakh's Wild Hunt' (1964). Most his
2020-02-12 21:25:15	--	- novels are about Belarus's past.  He won many national
