2020-10-24 23:31:45	captainchris	I would like change the tab of current page in config.py not autoconfig.yml. I change the value of colors.tabs.selected.even.bg but nothing change 
2020-10-24 23:31:54	captainchris	the color ^ 
2020-10-24 23:33:54	Ingvix	so how are you setting it
2020-10-24 23:34:08	captainchris	in qute://settings 
2020-10-24 23:34:50	Ingvix	that doesn't affect config.py. You have to type it there yourself
2020-10-24 23:34:59	Ingvix	or export you current configuration from qb
