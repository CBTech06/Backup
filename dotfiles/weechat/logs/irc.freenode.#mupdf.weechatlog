2020-11-10 13:20:43	artifexirc-bot	<sebras> @ator for thr record: I believe I've reviewed and LGTMed everything on tor/master.
2020-11-10 13:21:18	artifexirc-bot	<sebras> /me figures @ator has forgotten
2020-11-10 13:22:14	 *	sebras figures @ator has forgotten
2020-11-10 13:22:33	 *	malc_ is once again bedazzled by "i believe i did something in the past.." construction.
2020-11-10 13:23:44	@sebras	hm I need to lookup how to do/me using Discord, apparently this was not the way...
2020-11-10 13:24:24	@ator	@sebras okay, thank you!
2020-11-10 13:26:08	@sebras	malc_: I believe I've reviewed everything, but maybe I've missed something..?

2020-11-10 13:27:23	artifexirc-bot	<sebras> /me is not sure if it actually works...
2020-11-10 13:27:33	malc_	sebras: that's not at all my initial interpretation, which was - i believe i did a, b, c OTOH maybe i'm approaching senility and really did nothing of the sort
2020-11-10 13:27:40	artifexirc-bot	<ator> Oops. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
2020-11-10 13:27:53	artifexirc-bot	<ator> Oops. ┬─┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)
