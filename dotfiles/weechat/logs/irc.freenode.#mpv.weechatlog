2020-11-15 21:03:31	captainchris	Hi all
2020-11-15 21:04:36	captainchris	I have high CPU usage when I watch movie on mpv. 130 / 140% and after a momment my computer bug 
2020-11-15 21:07:10	letty	captainchris i have that problem sometimes, it's caused by my computer being very slow
2020-11-15 21:07:44	garoto	lol
2020-11-15 21:09:55	captainchris	I have a old intel I5 with 8G of ram. It's not a basic computer 
2020-11-15 21:10:17	garoto	"old intel i5" means nothing
2020-11-15 21:11:08	garoto	I have an "old intel i5" as well, and it can decode 1440p HEVC alright
2020-11-15 21:11:50	captainchris	Yes so why I have mpv problem. I have a lightweight system with i3wm and nothing 
2020-11-15 21:12:09	captainchris	I don't understand why mpv use high cpu like that 
2020-11-15 21:13:22	garoto	my point being there are many "old intel i5" potatoes around, so unless you clarify your specific HW combo, it's all a mistery
2020-11-15 21:17:02	artefact	also you might want to specify what vo, decoder you are using and what file you're playing (codec, resolution, fps, profile...)
2020-11-15 21:17:05	earnestly	captainchris: Decoding a non-hardware accelerated codec will do that, especially at 1080p60
2020-11-15 21:18:05	captainchris	Ok i use vo=xv I think that reduce cpu usage 
2020-11-15 21:18:20	captainchris	I need to change my graphic card to 
2020-11-15 21:18:20	 *	earnestly raises eyebrow
2020-11-15 21:18:39	artefact	isn't xv crap?
2020-11-15 21:18:53	earnestly	Yes lol
2020-11-15 21:19:10	durandal_1707	2020, and people still use xv....
2020-11-15 21:19:53	earnestly	Well it ought to not produce lower cpu usage, then
2020-11-15 21:19:55	artefact	maybe with 2005 hardware
2020-11-15 21:20:04	captainchris	It's on github on Sytsem requirement 
2020-11-15 21:20:30	captainchris	For the first time I read you say that i said a crap ;(
2020-11-15 21:20:33	durandal_1707	that is some sort of minimal and poor one
2020-11-15 21:20:56	earnestly	captainchris: lscpu will tell you the full cpu model name
2020-11-15 21:21:00	earnestly	Tell the fine people here
2020-11-15 21:21:42	artefact	or $(head -n5 /proc/cpuinfo)

2020-12-06 13:09:47	avih	like, the technicality of a programming language is not enough on its own, and is not important in the grand scheme of things. languages come and go, techniques and data structures stay.
2020-12-06 13:12:42	avih	though different languages lend themselves differently to different techniques or approaches
2020-12-06 13:19:12	captainchris	I have a problem with hw accel and mpv. I use nouveau driver on void linux. When i watch movie mpv use gpu instead vdpau-copy.with nvidia-gt240 it is possible to use vdpau-copy with nouveau ??
2020-12-06 13:19:52	JEEB	gpu is a renderer, not related to hwdec
2020-12-06 13:20:21	JEEB	for hwdec you can --hwdec=vdpau or vdpau-copy ?
2020-12-06 13:20:35	JEEB	although I would first check if you have vdpau available at all?
2020-12-06 13:20:57	JEEB	vdpauinfo should tell you if you have a vdpau driver or if the driver provides any functionality
2020-12-06 13:21:15	captainchris	Hi JEEB  thank's for your help 
2020-12-06 13:21:32	JEEB	so check that vdpauinfo outputs something successfully and such
2020-12-06 13:21:41	JEEB	that should tell you if you have a hwdec driver at all
2020-12-06 13:22:15	JEEB	although apparently nouveau uses vaapi?
2020-12-06 13:22:22	JEEB	> For Nouveau and the various AMD drivers, support can be added simply by installing the mesa-va-drivers package.
2020-12-06 13:22:33	captainchris	I don't know vaapi is not used by intel ??
2020-12-06 13:22:52	JEEB	although yes, apparently it also has a vdpau driver?

2020-12-06 13:24:54	captainchris	the problem with vdpau none decoder are supported 
2020-12-06 13:25:29	JEEB	just check if you have the right driver installed
2020-12-06 13:25:33	JEEB	but yes, that looks bad :D
2020-12-06 13:25:38	JEEB	check vainfo?
2020-12-06 13:25:57	JEEB	but yea, if nothing works then you just can't have hwdec with your nouveau setup. sorry.
2020-12-06 13:26:51	captainchris	I export DRI_PRIME=1 and VDPAU_DRIVER=nouveau like archwiki said 
2020-12-06 13:28:07	JEEB	then vdpauinfo should tell you the right thing
2020-12-06 13:28:13	JEEB	if it tells you nothing is supported then nothing is supported
2020-12-06 13:29:01	sfan5	did you make sure to configure nouveau as required to enable vdpau support?
2020-12-06 13:29:24	sfan5	I remember reading that it requires external firmware for decoding
2020-12-06 13:32:09	captainchris	sfan5: I install xf86-video-nouveau mesa-dri mesa-nouveau-dri mesa-vaapi mesa-vdpau
2020-12-06 13:32:59	sfan5	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Hardware_video_acceleration#NVIDIA mentions a firmware package
2020-12-06 13:34:27	captainchris	sfan I used voidlinux

2020-12-06 13:37:28	sfan5	it doesn't seem like you installed the necessary firmware package but I don't know where that would be on void linux
