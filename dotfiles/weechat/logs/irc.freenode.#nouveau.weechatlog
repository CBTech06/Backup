2020-11-22 13:52:32	SolarAquarion	nv130 is i guess in "mesa"
2020-11-22 13:53:06	HdkR	It's Pascal so it's supported in mesa
2020-11-22 13:54:29	HdkR	But what sort of hardware acceleration? 3D? Video?

2020-12-06 13:03:49	captainchris	Hi everybody. I have an old nvidia gt240 with nouveau driver it works fine for basic usage. If i watch movie with mpv. MPV uses gpu instead of vdpau-copy. Is it normal ?? 
2020-12-06 13:04:49	captainchris	I can't use vdpau to watch movie. I set VDPAU_DRIVER="nouveau" and DRI_PRIME=1

2020-12-06 13:25:49	jschwart	hi all, I'm facing a system with a "NVIDIA Corporation GF116 [GeForce GTS 450 Rev. 2]", the NVIDIA drivers do not work very well, Nouveau as provided by the OS is 1.0.16 (last release but 22 months old?)
2020-12-06 13:26:29	jschwart	the system is primarily used for basic web browsing and so on with a single screen attached, would switching to Nouveau likely work better?
2020-12-06 13:28:16	captainchris	jschwart: and when you watch movie the computer freeze ???
2020-12-06 13:37:32	jschwart	captainchris: no, that I didn't see

2020-12-06 14:09:33	juri_	I'm having infrequent freezes with kernel errors on 5.9, using both displays of a quadro 600. it doesn't take the machine out, but the first restart of xdm gives me garbled displays, the second one brings online the dvi display (leaving the display port one black). a full reboot gets me both displays again.
2020-12-06 14:10:03	juri_	not a complaint, just an observation. keep up the good work, and let me know if i can help in any way.
