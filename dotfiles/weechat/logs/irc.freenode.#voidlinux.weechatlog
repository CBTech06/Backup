2020-10-24 21:01:14	captainchris	hi everybody 
2020-10-24 21:01:17	nonchip	and if the prof knows anything about what they should be teaching, the first thing they'd teach you would be not to believe them everything

2020-10-24 21:01:44	nonchip	how can that be pushing anything except someone's curiosity and drive to think critically about things?
2020-10-24 21:01:45	earnestly	Is that what yours taught you?
2020-10-24 21:02:01	ericonr	captainchris: hi
2020-10-24 21:02:58	nonchip	no, we didn't have that. well maybe my religion teacher a bit, she at least didn't just go "here's what the bible says" but also "and here's what other books say, oh and what do you think, and why might that've been useful back then and is it still?"
2020-10-24 21:04:22	ericonr	nonchip: is it okay to thank god for me never having attended religion classes?
2020-10-24 21:04:43	earnestly	ericonr: It wouldn't mean very much to you would it though
2020-10-24 21:04:46	nonchip	which i mean is probably better to do in religion than maths, but i don't see how applying that same thinking to more facets of society than just religion is a bad thing? unless that is you do have an agenda you don't want people to think about
2020-10-24 21:05:00	captainchris	I discovered void linux with youtube movie 
2020-10-24 21:05:21	captainchris	I'm archlinux user since 5 years 
2020-10-24 21:05:32	earnestly	nonchip: They are doing it in maths, 2+2=5
2020-10-24 21:05:36	nonchip	ericonr: i mean depends. do you believe in a god? if yes, do you believe they'd care? if yes do you believe they'd find it ok? if yes or any of the before were no, go ahead
2020-10-24 21:06:19	nonchip	earnestly: if that were true you wouldn't have been able to send that rather ...... interesting line now would you?
2020-10-24 21:06:32	earnestly	nonchip: Hm?
2020-10-24 21:06:43	ericonr	nonchip: I was mostly joking :P
2020-10-24 21:06:47	nonchip	oh just that we know maths work because computers just work because of it
2020-10-24 21:06:51	nonchip	*maths works
2020-10-24 21:06:56	ericonr	captainchris: we are in a movie??
2020-10-24 21:07:25	dTal	computers work??

2020-10-24 21:08:01	nonchip	yup
2020-10-24 21:08:34	nonchip	wouldn't work if 4 was 5
2020-10-24 21:08:42	earnestly	Certainly wouldn't
2020-10-24 21:08:52	nonchip	just ask Gul Madred.
2020-10-24 21:09:13	ericonr	nonchip: well
2020-10-24 21:09:19	ericonr	4 being 5 is just security factor
2020-10-24 21:09:21	earnestly	Not familiar?
2020-10-24 21:09:29	ericonr	I think it could work
2020-10-24 21:09:30	earnestly	With that name
2020-10-24 21:09:34	ericonr	at least for bridges

2020-10-24 21:29:51	nrb	i have an idea for xbps, maybe someone else will like it too
2020-10-24 21:30:01	nrb	why not adding some sort of labels option when u install a pkg
2020-10-24 21:30:37	nrb	like xbps-install -S gnome-terminal -l DE
2020-10-24 21:30:46	ericonr	like metadata?
2020-10-24 21:31:11	nrb	if i list installed packages with xbps-query -m or whatever and i give a flag like -l (list by labels), it will show me what package are under the label DE
2020-10-24 21:31:27	nrb	it would be useful if u wanna install packages separately which are meant to form a bigger thing like your own DE
2020-10-24 21:31:46	nrb	you could also organize stuff like xbps-install -S vim tmux -l worktools
2020-10-24 21:32:04	nrb	now you know if you want to list your worktools you just do xbps-query -ml and see what is there for worktools
2020-10-24 21:32:30	nrb	also you often have this problem when u install something like wine, you need to install many additional dependencies, if you wanna uninstall wine it's a problem to find unused packages again
2020-10-24 21:32:35	captainchris	is voidlinux based on arch ?? 
2020-10-24 21:32:42	duncaen	no?
2020-10-24 21:32:45	nrb	no it's not, it's an independent distro
2020-10-24 21:33:02	duncaen	its like the first point on voidlinux.org
2020-10-24 21:33:30	minikN	:D
2020-10-24 21:34:05	captainchris	I like lightweight distro 
2020-10-24 21:34:06	nrb	i just uninstalled NsCDE, it required me to install many additional separate dependencies, now i don't know what these packages were because i didn't save them or anything
2020-10-24 21:34:17	nrb	if i would do xbps-install name -l nscde for every package i install, i could easily identify it
2020-10-24 21:34:29	captainchris	I love tiling windows and lightweight app like qutebrowser weechat cmus .... 
2020-10-24 21:34:52	nrb	ericonr: yes, it could be realized through metadata, just save the labelname if it was given for the installed package or w/e
2020-10-24 21:35:08	minikN	captainchris: But those have nothing to do with void. Have they?
2020-10-24 21:39:45	duncaen	nrb: apk has something like that I think is better than calling it label
2020-10-24 21:39:57	duncaen	they use the name virtual packages for that
2020-10-24 21:40:14	duncaen	apk add --virtual devel gcc make
2020-10-24 21:40:25	duncaen	so the virtual package devel will depend on gcc and make
2020-10-24 21:40:36	duncaen	the default is world I think
2020-10-24 21:40:49	duncaen	and world depends on all installed and virtual packages
2020-10-24 21:40:52	nrb	i just want an easy to use and fast way to label packages

2020-10-24 21:41:17	nrb	and see what i have to uninstall
2020-10-24 21:41:28	duncaen	which is similiar or the same for your usecase
2020-10-24 21:41:45	duncaen	but if you do it with virtual packages as concept you get something like xbps-remove -R wine-libs too

2020-10-24 21:42:54	nrb	my idea is simple, maybe i will take a look at it
2020-10-24 21:42:56	nrb	and do it for myself
2020-10-24 21:43:20	duncaen	well its not a good design
2020-10-24 21:43:38	duncaen	solves nothing other then your specific usecase
2020-10-24 21:43:52	duncaen	which you could do with plain text files with list of packages
2020-10-24 21:43:55	nrb	this is why i might do it myself

2020-11-30 21:29:38	captainchris	Hi everybody 
2020-11-30 21:30:47	captainchris	I have a samsung NC10 netbook It is working with archlinux32 bit. Can i install 686 voidlinux ??
2020-11-30 21:30:59	nrb	should work, why wouldn't it?
2020-11-30 21:31:40	nrb	i would even recommend it because xbps is fast, for me it's faster than pacman on weak hardware like rpi3
2020-11-30 21:32:07	captainchris	I have all my computer on linux since 5 years
2020-11-30 21:32:13	ericonr	nrb: just xbps-pkgdb -a to check your files
2020-11-30 21:32:17	captainchris	And i would change to void

2020-11-30 21:33:12	nrb	captainchris: go for it,

2020-11-30 21:44:01	shahab	I've gotta say, the set up time in void was reasonably low. that is very good.
2020-11-30 21:44:40	shahab	having the sources in the dbg packages would be the best
2020-11-30 21:45:12	ericonr	I won't say it's WIP
2020-11-30 21:45:16	ericonr	because it isn't
2020-11-30 21:45:24	ericonr	although... it's work in planning
2020-11-30 21:45:27	ericonr	so WIP
2020-11-30 21:45:47	shahab	not that it is my problem right now, but if somebody needs to debug a different/lower version of a package, this way (having dbg and sources in one package) would make things much simpler.

2020-12-01 22:48:10	atkka	with more and more seeming to require pulse will pipewire spoof the pulse dependency?

2020-12-01 22:48:37	ericonr	that's a corrupted drive or you installed the wrong arch
2020-12-01 22:48:52	captainchris	and the biggest problem is man it print -b : 1: Syntax error: unterminated quoted string 
2020-12-01 22:49:42	captainchris	I downloaded void-live-x86_64-musl 
2020-12-01 22:49:50	captainchris	It is correct 
2020-12-01 22:50:14	ndowens	may have installed glibc pkgs instead of musl?
2020-12-01 22:50:40	captainchris	I don't know i installed package with xbps-install -S 
2020-12-01 22:50:54	atkka	did you export XBPS_ARCH=musl
2020-12-01 22:50:59	captainchris	nope
2020-12-01 22:51:09	atkka	I'm pretty sure that is needed before install
2020-12-01 22:51:10	captainchris	Okay I retry tomorow 
2020-12-01 22:51:22	atkka	haven't ran the musl flavor in a bit though
2020-12-01 22:52:03	captainchris	thank's guys
2020-12-01 22:52:09	ericonr	hm shouldn't be required
2020-12-01 22:52:12	ericonr	you are installing from musl
2020-12-01 22:52:16	ericonr	just run xbps-pkgdb -a
2020-12-01 22:52:21	atkka	it used to be if doing chroot install
2020-12-01 22:52:23	ericonr	and it should complain about your packages
2020-12-01 22:52:29	ericonr	atkka: ooh
2020-12-01 22:52:31	ericonr	true
2020-12-01 22:52:37	ericonr	or possibly not
2020-12-01 22:52:46	ericonr	there's some weird logic around the arch stuff
2020-12-01 22:53:29	ndowens	captainchris: next time do: ARCH=x86_64-musl xbps-install -S -r /mnt -R $REPO_URL base-system
2020-12-01 22:53:35	atkka	I had to explicitly export the XBPS_ARCH even when booting from musl live image before xbps-install -S -R -r /mnt
2020-12-01 22:53:38	captainchris	ericonr: your command print lot's of error hash mismatch ... 
2020-12-01 22:53:38	atkka	etc
2020-12-01 22:53:44	ndowens	on one line replace $REPO_URL with the url of course
2020-12-01 22:53:56	captainchris	ok I retry an install tomorow 
2020-12-01 22:54:05	captainchris	yes all my pkg are wrong ;) 
2020-12-01 22:54:09	ericonr	captainchris: oops
2020-12-01 22:54:20	ericonr	so do xbps-install -f $all_those_packages
2020-12-01 22:54:34	ericonr	although you should look into how they got screwed
2020-12-01 22:55:50	captainchris	thanks guys for your help

2020-12-03 20:30:42	neffi	There's more to data integrity than checksumming everything. ZFS is carefully designed and implemented for robustness and integrity as a constraint. bcache's designers just don't strike me as the type to carefully contemplate design choices, to be frank
2020-12-03 20:31:08	anddam	semi-OT question: how can I manage mimetypes in my xorg session?

2020-12-03 20:41:08	nbm	yes i just checked
2020-12-03 20:41:09	anddam	because someone else put some xdg-mime default in other profile files

2020-12-14 21:17:03	eoli3n	saw this
2020-12-14 21:17:09	eoli3n	that's where i found the link
2020-12-14 21:17:12	eoli3n	http://54.37.137.89/pkgs.void/package/gummiboot
2020-12-14 21:17:36	eoli3n	but ... you know ^^ lets try the zfsbootmenu way directly
2020-12-14 21:20:12	eoli3n	just a thing, how did you asciinema a reboot... ?
2020-12-14 21:22:16	ericonr	secret sauce
2020-12-14 21:22:23	ericonr	and virtual machines
2020-12-14 21:22:23	eoli3n	come on :P
2020-12-14 21:22:34	ericonr	at least I think that one was vm
2020-12-14 21:22:39	eoli3n	so mysterious
2020-12-14 21:22:58	eoli3n	how can you asciinema on a VM
2020-12-14 21:23:53	nonchip	one way that comes to mind: you can connect to it via virtual serial port and record from the outside while it's rebooting
2020-12-14 21:24:09	eoli3n	hm, never tried this
2020-12-14 21:24:34	nonchip	because unlike ssh that's gonna be up almost immediately so the only thing you miss is the bios

2020-12-14 21:28:28	eoli3n	is there any xbps hook to automate boot env creation ?
2020-12-14 21:28:54	eoli3n	i did this for zectl and pacman : https://github.com/eoli3n/zectl-pacman-hook
2020-12-14 21:29:04	nonchip	yeah most boot envs use it, check for how e.g. dracut or zfsbootmenu do it
2020-12-14 21:29:47	eoli3n	i don't get your answer
2020-12-14 21:29:53	eoli3n	maybe i misexplained what i want
2020-12-14 21:30:25	eoli3n	or ... ok, dracut has a hook to create zfsbootmenu AND a bootenv ?
2020-12-14 21:33:35	nonchip	not sure what exactly you mean by bootenv, but dracut and zfsbootmenu both take care of updating their stuff automatically

2020-12-14 21:34:18	ericonr	are those cloned datasets?
2020-12-14 21:34:54	eoli3n	isn't a boot env a dataset with /boot managed ?
2020-12-14 21:35:03	ericonr	ah, that's from the example
2020-12-14 21:35:07	eoli3n	yes
2020-12-14 21:35:23	ericonr	not managed, it's just /boot as void leaves it
2020-12-14 21:35:26	nonchip	again, i don't know what "a boot env" is supposed to be, but those there are root filesystems
2020-12-14 21:35:27	ericonr	with initramfs and ernel

2020-12-14 21:35:43	eoli3n	a boot env is a bootable zfs snapshot
2020-12-14 21:36:04	ericonr	 /boot just can't be a mount point
2020-12-14 21:36:24	eoli3n	so my question is, zfsbootmenu provide a way to boot boot env, but how to automate boot env creation
2020-12-14 21:36:30	ericonr	you don't do anything
2020-12-14 21:36:40	ericonr	the root filesystem already has all you need
2020-12-14 21:36:44	eoli3n	ok, so it managed this by default
2020-12-14 21:36:52	eoli3n	hm
2020-12-14 21:36:52	ericonr	(assuming you added the required files in /etc/dracut.conf.d)
2020-12-14 21:37:07	eoli3n	what do you mean by "the root filesystem already has all you need"
2020-12-14 21:37:08	ericonr	so the final initramfs contains zfs modules
2020-12-14 21:37:09	eoli3n	all i need to ?
2020-12-14 21:37:15	eoli3n	that's not my question
2020-12-14 21:37:19	ericonr	all zbm needs to boot into it, rather
2020-12-14 21:37:33	eoli3n	ok so lets restart fresh
2020-12-14 21:37:41	eoli3n	my question is not "how zbm works" but
2020-12-14 21:37:50	eoli3n	it is used to boot zfs snapshot
2020-12-14 21:37:53	eoli3n	+s
2020-12-14 21:37:57	eoli3n	how to create those
2020-12-14 21:38:33	eoli3n	in the exmeple you can see two snapshots
2020-12-14 21:38:42	nonchip	by making snapshots.
2020-12-14 21:38:43	eoli3n	are they automatically created when kernel upgraded ?

2020-12-14 21:39:49	nonchip	they're made when you make them, or you could use a program like sanoid to automate that
2020-12-14 21:39:59	eoli3n	is that easy to write xbps hooks ?

2020-12-14 21:44:04	nonchip	i know all of those words but i have no idea what you just said :D
2020-12-14 21:44:25	eoli3n	zfsbootmenu is much better than zectl, with zectl you need separated /boot to be read by bootloader. Then you can't create more boot env than you /boot size can support
2020-12-14 21:44:54	eoli3n	than your*
2020-12-14 21:45:09	nonchip	pretty sure you still need that, but just to install zfsbootmenu into
2020-12-14 21:45:09	eoli3n	sometimes, i don't know what i'm saying too :)
2020-12-14 21:45:47	ericonr	nonchip: but once you have that, you can install any number of distros/whatever and it will still work :)
2020-12-14 21:45:48	eoli3n	i don't think, zectl is boot env manager for systemd-boot/gummiboot
2020-12-14 21:45:56	nonchip	ericonr: yup
2020-12-14 21:46:05	ericonr	not that I use it for much
2020-12-14 21:46:15	ericonr	I have only a musl and a glibc BE
2020-12-14 21:46:34	eoli3n	you mean that you still use a bootloader to not be stuck on you zfs boot envs ?
2020-12-14 21:46:38	nonchip	eoli3n: no i mean you still need a boot partition for uefi (mounted to /boot/efi) but your actual /boot with the kernels is in the zfs like you said
2020-12-14 21:46:50	ericonr	^^
2020-12-14 21:46:53	eoli3n	nonchip so i misexplained
2020-12-14 21:47:12	nonchip	because you need something in /boot/efi to load zfsbootmenu

2020-12-14 21:48:06	nonchip	and where would that file go? ;)
2020-12-14 21:48:11	ericonr	unless you use a USB drive for that
2020-12-14 21:48:12	eoli3n	yes in a separated /efi
2020-12-14 21:48:13	ericonr	which is an option
2020-12-14 21:48:23	eoli3n	but /boot is embeeded in the snapshot
2020-12-14 21:48:24	nonchip	well a separated /boot/efi usually but yes
2020-12-14 21:48:27	eoli3n	which is not with zectl
2020-12-14 21:48:44	nonchip	yeah /boot is in the zfs, but /boot/efi is a mountpoint for the separate efi boot partition.
2020-12-14 21:49:10	eoli3n	with zectl you need kernel/initrd to be readable by your bootloader, so you can't embed them in the snapshot

2020-12-14 21:49:58	nonchip	but zfsbootmenu is actually a tiny linux that gets booted and then boots your actual one
2020-12-14 21:50:07	eoli3n	and it snapshot kernel/initrd manually
2020-12-14 21:50:20	eoli3n	yep i get that, and that's the clever way :)
2020-12-14 21:50:36	nonchip	yup
2020-12-14 21:51:12	eoli3n	hm then what's the lightest choice if i still want a bootloader ?
2020-12-14 21:51:35	eoli3n	a not deprecated one
2020-12-14 21:51:39	eoli3n	:°

Void does not have an `openssl` package.  when I run `openssl genpkey -algorithm x25519` I get the error "Algorithm x25519 not found".  I have searched the output of `openssl list-*` with `grep` for "25519" and did not get any results.  I do not see 25519 in the output of `openssl ecparam -list_curves`.
2021-02-21 19:07:40	bone-baboon	However on another system with `openssl` installed this command works: `openssl genpkey -algorithm x25519`.
