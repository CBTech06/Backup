2020-12-14 21:28:19	ronniedroid	That is called pinning workspace to monitors
2020-12-14 21:28:37	ronniedroid	There is an issue on it on the qtile github 
2020-12-14 21:28:53	ronniedroid	But, it is not very straight forward how to do it
2020-12-14 21:29:49	ronniedroid	I myself am trying to learn how to use the qtile way of managing workspaces in multimonitor setup

2020-12-20 17:33:14	mcol	Are you using the right Match syntax for your version? There have been some changes to that recent
2020-12-20 17:33:25	mcol	Is this git version or a release?
2020-12-20 17:44:49	--	tcl1 is now known as tcl
2020-12-20 17:51:23	captainchris	it's a git version 
2020-12-20 17:51:32	captainchris	if i use letters it works
2020-12-20 17:51:43	captainchris	if i use azerty for 12345
2020-12-20 17:51:45	captainchris	6
2020-12-20 18:10:31	mcol	that seems weird
2020-12-20 18:10:41	mcol	any log output when it fails?

2020-12-20 19:07:16	@tych0	looks like ci is having some issues with cairo all of the sudden?
2020-12-20 19:15:07	@tych0	and oddly they're two different failures
2020-12-20 19:19:05	dditthardt	re-run?
2020-12-20 19:19:39	dditthardt	library versions haven't changed in ubuntu
2020-12-20 19:20:00	dditthardt	(in the middle of getting actions to run locally)
2020-12-20 19:21:57	@tych0	dditthardt: i'd re run but then we'd lose the logs :)
2020-12-20 19:25:13	dditthardt	download them!
2020-12-20 19:27:45	@tych0	this actually looks like it could be an xcffib bug
2020-12-20 19:28:02	@tych0	dditthardt: maybe. i'd prefer to just leave them where they are vs. having all green tests
2020-12-20 19:28:13	@tych0	that way if someone searches again maybe they'll find them
2020-12-20 19:28:49	@tych0	but in any case
2020-12-20 19:28:56	@tych0	this looks like somthing went horribly wrong...

2020-12-20 20:56:21	tcl	I just noticed that my ScratchPads are broken. I have only had a short look at the recent commits, can somebody try to open a ScratchPad, please? mcol maybe?
2020-12-20 21:33:58	mcol	tcl: working just as usual for me on master
2020-12-20 21:34:06	tcl	Thanks for checking.
2020-12-20 21:34:52	tcl	I think I just found the cause, the wm_class and title aren't properly set anymore. That's likely something on my end.
2020-12-20 22:04:55	captainchris	hi is there a solution to hise mouse cursor and use qtile mouseless without use of unclutter and xinput ??
2020-12-20 22:05:07	captainchris	to hide ^

2020-12-20 22:12:36	mcol	hi captainchris 
2020-12-20 22:12:50	mcol	i think unclutter is the only way you're going to get that
2020-12-20 22:12:53	mcol	although.........
2020-12-20 22:13:18	mcol	you could use xcffib to hide/show mouse upon keybindings/hooks if you figured out how!
2020-12-20 22:16:02	captainchris	okay
2020-12-20 22:17:33	mcol	i have a snippet that might help
2020-12-20 22:17:34	mcol	one sec
2020-12-20 22:20:32	mcol	https://f.mcol.xyz/1608499726.py
2020-12-20 22:21:17	mcol	i think something like that should work, if you bind show_cursor and hide_cursor to keybindings, or execute them at hooks or whatever
2020-12-20 22:32:31	captainchris	ok it's pretty cool 
2020-12-20 22:32:35	captainchris	thank you
