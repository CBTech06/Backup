2020-03-23 22:20:18	captainchris	hi everybody
2020-03-23 22:21:20	captainchris	I'm new on wxwidgets I'm trying to code hello world from the wxwidget site 
2020-03-23 22:21:46	captainchris	I have GUI but I don't have menu and statusbar 
2020-03-23 22:21:53	captainchris	I paste my code 
2020-03-23 22:22:02	captainchris	https://pastebin.com/250WsSiY
2020-03-23 22:22:09	captainchris	Header file 
2020-03-23 22:22:19	captainchris	https://pastebin.com/iEyWTtmk
2020-03-23 22:22:24	captainchris	CPP file
2020-03-23 22:23:15	captainchris	do you have an idea ?? 
2020-03-23 22:25:46	DavidGH	captainchris: Caused by your OS or theme not liking *bars?
2020-03-23 22:26:44	DavidGH	What happens if you build wx yourself and build/run the 'minimal' sample?
2020-03-23 22:26:44	DavidGH	(Or, if your OS provides binaries of the samples, run it direct)
2020-03-23 22:28:19	captainchris	I have i3WM
2020-03-23 22:29:12	captainchris	but I must have to menufile 
2020-03-23 22:29:35	captainchris	I'm going to add text label on my wxframe
2020-03-23 22:30:39	specing	captainchris: why wx?
2020-03-23 22:30:49	DavidGH	I've never used i3WM. Do other similar programs have bars?
2020-03-23 22:31:14	captainchris	no I havge no titlebar 
2020-03-23 22:31:26	captainchris	but i have menubar in other application 
2020-03-23 22:31:39	DavidGH	OK
2020-03-23 22:35:40	captainchris	I'm trying to add a button to my frame 
2020-03-23 22:35:51	captainchris	and I look if it works

2020-03-23 23:02:24	captainchris	I have a problem with my button  undefined reference to `wxControl::SetFont(wxFont const&)'
2020-03-23 23:02:50	captainchris	If i disable constructor for my button I don't have error
2020-03-23 23:06:02	DavidGH	Have you updated the pastebins with the button code?
2020-03-23 23:06:16	captainchris	 nope 
2020-03-23 23:06:29	captainchris	I'm doing it 
2020-03-23 23:08:03	captainchris	https://pastebin.com/UDHFmJD5
2020-03-23 23:08:27	captainchris	I tried with wxT("Quit")
2020-03-23 23:08:31	captainchris	but same problem 
2020-03-23 23:13:01	DavidGH	You seem to be trying to derive your Button class from wxFrame
2020-03-23 23:13:31	DavidGH	why not from wxButton, if indeed you need a subclassed button at all?
2020-03-23 23:14:34	DavidGH	I strongly suggest that you download the wxWidgets tarball (probably the latest stable, 3.0.4) and at least _look_ at the samples/ dir
2020-03-23 23:15:00	DavidGH	Ideally build wx3.0.4 too. Then you can build and run any of the samples
2020-03-23 23:16:04	captainchris	I'm on arch and i have the wxgtk3 3.0.4-2
2020-03-23 23:18:06	DavidGH	Does it come with a samples package, or supply the samples in some other way?
2020-03-23 23:19:12	DavidGH	If not, it's still worth downloading the tarball. You can probably configure/build the samples against your distro's wx
2020-03-23 23:20:54	captainchris	I have sample ont github 
2020-03-23 23:21:41	captainchris	on zetcode class inherite from wxFrame 
2020-03-23 23:21:46	captainchris	http://zetcode.com/gui/wxwidgets/firstprograms/
2020-03-23 23:27:50	DavidGH	That sample calls its subclassed wxFrame 'Button' (which is silly, but...)
2020-03-23 23:28:31	DavidGH	but it's still a frame. It adds a wxButton later:
2020-03-23 23:28:37	DavidGH	wxButton *button = new wxButton(panel, wxID_EXIT, wxT("Quit"),   wxPoint(20, 20));
2020-03-23 23:29:39	DavidGH	All you need to do is to put that code line, and other relevant ones, into your original tutorial code
2020-03-23 23:30:04	captainchris	iin my wxFrame implementation ?? 
2020-03-23 23:30:18	 *	DavidGH still recommends the wx samples, which are _known_ to work
2020-03-23 23:30:36	DavidGH	Into the original code you pastebinned
2020-03-23 23:31:33	DavidGH	You need a frame class, derived from wxFrame. You add other things inside the frame constructor
2020-03-23 23:31:53	DavidGH	Those other things can include a wxButton, which you _don't_ subclass
2020-03-23 23:32:13	DavidGH	(unless you think you can design a better button than wx/gtk+)
2020-03-23 23:36:39	specing	captainchris: why are you using wxwidgets and not gtk directly?
2020-03-23 23:37:23	captainchris	why wxwidget is bad ??
2020-03-23 23:38:05	specing	I'm not implying that
2020-03-23 23:38:08	specing	I'm just asking
2020-03-23 23:38:37	captainchris	everybody says wxwidget is better
2020-03-23 23:40:21	specing	I've done some work maintaining a wxwidgets app. While the API is stable over a very long time, the problem is that some things are very hard to do. Such as theming (that modern users expect)
2020-03-23 23:41:27	captainchris	It's my first time with GUI I code with sfml and I would create a tilemap editor to improve my skill 
2020-03-23 23:41:47	captainchris	I choice wxwidget after a search on internet
2020-03-23 23:42:43	captainchris	my first choice was fltk  and after i decided to change for wxwidget 
2020-03-23 23:54:24	captainchris	Ok I ve found the solution 
2020-03-24 00:05:30	captainchris	on my makefile I build my project with wx-config-gtk3 on CXXFLAGS and I missed on LIBS
2020-03-24 00:05:47	captainchris	I used wx-config
2020-03-24 00:06:53	captainchris	and I have menubar and statusbar :(
2020-03-24 00:07:09	captainchris	I'm really stupid. thx for your help

2020-03-24 21:15:18	DavidGH	captainchris: I've no knowledge/experience of tilemap editors, but I doubt that wxGrid is what you want
2020-03-24 21:16:38	captainchris	Hi david yes. but i don't know if wxImage is the good solution 
2020-03-24 21:16:39	DavidGH	If you want images in a grid pattern, wxStaticBitmaps in a gridsizer sounds more likely
2020-03-24 21:21:16	captainchris	I think I will use a panel like image panel on the wxwiki 
2020-03-24 22:47:41	robert_	so hum, how do I use a FlexGridSizer? like how do I specify what row/column it's in?
2020-03-24 22:47:55	robert_	(sorry, for example, a Static text control)

2020-03-25 17:39:52	captainchris	I downloaded wxwidgets it is possible to build only samples ?? 
2020-03-25 18:05:23	DavidGH	captainchris: You need to run ./configure in the (extracted tarball) wx dir, using similar options to those of your system's wx install
2020-03-25 18:05:55	DavidGH	e.g. ./configure --with-gtk=3
2020-03-25 18:06:28	DavidGH	Then you should be able to cd into samples/ and run make -j to build them all,
2020-03-25 18:07:02	DavidGH	or e.g. cd samples/minimal && make   to build just that sample
2020-03-25 18:34:11	robert_	so can I justify text with wx?
2020-03-25 18:34:30	robert_	like how it appears in a book, nice and aligned
2020-03-25 18:35:49	robert_	or 'text-align: justify' (in css)
2020-03-25 18:38:49	captainchris	.david thanks
2020-03-25 18:40:59	DavidGH	robert_: Inside which control? e.g. are you using wxRichTextCtrl, or wxHtml* or...
2020-03-25 18:42:37	robert_	Any control, I I need a text label to be justified.
2020-03-25 18:43:54	robert_	I am asking if it's easy enough to accomplish using something not html
2020-03-25 18:44:41	DavidGH	As you'd have seen from its doc page, wxStaticText supports e.g. wxALIGN_LEFT, but it doesn't pretend to be a richtext control
2020-03-25 18:45:16	DavidGH	OTOH wxRichTextCtrl is a bit over-the-top for a simple label
2020-03-25 18:46:15	robert_	yeah
2020-03-25 18:47:08	DavidGH	As ever, run some relevant wx samples and see what suits you
2020-03-25 18:52:53	robert_	am, was just wondering if you had anything that came to mind. :D
2020-03-25 18:53:26	robert_	anyway https://i2.wp.com/justinakapaste.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tumblr_n03c59E4SK1trn8dmo4_500.jpg, kind of like this, lol
2020-03-25 19:17:19	DavidGH	robert_: Which of the jpg files were you thinking of?
2020-03-25 19:17:42	DavidGH	s/files/fields
2020-03-25 19:27:47	robert_	the text up top; it should justify if it wraps more than one line
2020-03-25 19:32:54	DavidGH	If you're using wx3.1 wxStaticText supports https://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_control.html#afeb308dc3b54d8d735b33cb250395503
2020-03-25 19:33:08	DavidGH	Otherwise probably a read-only wxTextCtrl
2020-03-25 19:35:21	robert_	yeah I'm using 3.x
2020-03-25 19:39:13	robert_	I just want a label that applies justification like in a book, lol

2020-03-30 21:58:02	robert_	DavidGH: I snipped it down to just the class I'm having issues with. :D
2020-03-30 22:09:18	DavidGH	You are trying to catch mouseevents in a wxPanel. Does the panel have any child controls?
2020-03-30 22:09:39	DavidGH	If so, they won't tell the panel about their mouseevents
2020-03-30 22:10:41	DavidGH	Does OnMouseEvent() catch anything? You're only printing if dragging is found, not if it isn't
2020-03-30 22:12:37	DavidGH	A general comment: you are starting with something complicated and trying to get it to work.
2020-03-30 22:13:48	DavidGH	I strongly suggest that you keep it simple; make a minimal program that just tests mouse events,
2020-03-30 22:13:48	DavidGH	not something that resembles the final product
2020-03-30 22:14:10	DavidGH	Once it works, morph it into what you really want
2020-03-30 22:25:27	robert_	okay
2020-03-30 22:25:53	robert_	so it catches events
2020-03-30 22:25:54	robert_	however
2020-03-30 22:26:07	robert_	I get no events when trying to drag the button around
2020-03-30 22:31:22	DavidGH	Maybe the button is receiving the events. If so, the panel won't see them
2020-03-30 22:31:58	DavidGH	You would need to tell the button to pass them on to the panel e.g. by using Bind()
2020-03-30 22:37:08	robert_	I handle both, though
2020-03-30 22:38:08	robert_	instance is the button
2020-03-30 22:42:09	robert_	hmmm

2020-04-23 11:30:40	captainchris	can i Use wxscrolledwindows without class 
2020-04-23 11:31:07	captainchris	I have a GUI class who inherite wxFrame I want a scrolled window inside of it 
2020-04-23 11:33:25	DavidGH	captainchris: Do you mean "...without subclassing"?
2020-04-23 11:34:00	captainchris	yes like class GUI: public wxFrame 
2020-04-23 11:34:28	captainchris	{ wxScrolledWindow* scrolledwin ....
2020-04-23 11:34:43	DavidGH	See the samples that come with the wxWidgets source.
2020-04-23 11:35:46	DavidGH	There's the 'propgrid' sample that certainly does. There's also a 'scoll' sample that you should look at.
2020-04-23 11:36:16	DavidGH	*'scroll' sample
2020-04-23 11:36:56	captainchris	ok I see dnd sample and all use wxscrolledwindow inherited 
2020-04-23 11:37:42	DavidGH	^^
2020-04-23 11:38:13	captainchris	simple question 
2020-04-23 11:38:28	DavidGH	m_panel = new wxScrolledWindow(...)
2020-04-23 11:38:37	captainchris	do you think it's possible to code without sample just to use api??
2020-04-23 11:39:10	DavidGH	'code without sample' ??
2020-04-23 11:39:21	captainchris	yes 
2020-04-23 11:39:30	DavidGH	What does that mean?
2020-04-23 11:39:49	captainchris	programming application without sample just with api 
2020-04-23 11:40:16	DavidGH	I don't understand what you mean by 'sample'
2020-04-23 11:40:50	DavidGH	The wxWidgets samples, that are there to help you understand how to do things?
2020-04-23 11:41:17	captainchris	yes but do you think we programming without ??

2020-04-23 11:43:15	DavidGH	But! If that fails, if you read the docs but they don't answer your questions,
2020-04-23 11:43:25	DavidGH	then look at the samples
2020-04-23 11:44:06	DavidGH	Build the relevant samples too, and run them
2020-04-23 11:44:30	DavidGH	That way you can see what wxWidgets can do

2020-04-25 21:20:43	DavidGH	https://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/classwx_evt_handler.html#a03cc68ca201fb79c7e837919025be71a
2020-04-25 21:36:05	captainchris	the second
2020-04-25 21:37:42	DavidGH	Bind (const EventTag &eventType, void(Class::*method)(EventArg &), EventHandler *handler, int id=wxID_ANY, int lastId=wxID_ANY, wxObject *userData=NULL)
2020-04-25 21:37:42	DavidGH	So the first parameter, eventType, is wxEVT_COMMAND_MENU_SELECTED. That's fine
2020-04-25 21:40:55	captainchris	I see that on doc
2020-04-25 21:40:58	DavidGH	The second parameter, Class::*method, &GUI::OnQuit, is OK too. What about the third?
2020-04-25 21:40:58	captainchris	Bind(wxEVT_MENU, &MyFrame::OnExit, this, wxID_EXIT);
2020-04-25 21:41:10	captainchris	but why wxID_EXIT on the end ?? 
2020-04-25 21:42:08	DavidGH	You could use wxID_ANY (which is -1) for both event-ids if you wanted. But you actually only want to bind exit events
2020-04-25 21:42:12	captainchris	I do that  Bind(wxEVT_COMMAND_MENU_SELECTED,&GUI::OnQuit,this,wxID_EXIT);
2020-04-25 21:42:30	DavidGH	So you tell the Bind() to ignore anything that is not wxID_EXIT
2020-04-25 21:42:34	captainchris	wxID_EXIT is int id 
2020-04-25 21:42:39	DavidGH	Yes
2020-04-25 21:43:49	captainchris	I've lo'ts of difficult to read API 
2020-04-25 21:43:53	DavidGH	The 5th parameter is only used if you need to catch a _range_ of events. The 6th is almost never used so don't worry about it
2020-04-25 21:44:04	DavidGH	Yes, Bind() is difficult
2020-04-25 21:44:39	DavidGH	Examples are much easier, though. The wx samples were written before Bind() was invented
2020-04-25 21:44:54	DavidGH	but it is used in one of them
2020-04-25 21:46:41	captainchris	Yes it uses connect 
2020-04-25 21:46:52	captainchris	and i saw on the doc connect is deprecated 
2020-04-25 21:47:20	captainchris	I need to learning to read API

2020-08-21 16:25:21	captainchris	It's not a bug of wxwidget ?? 
2020-08-21 16:25:24	DavidGH	captainchris: I can't see anything in your posted code that will be affected by the cursor location (do you mean mouse cursor?)
2020-08-21 16:25:47	captainchris	yes 
2020-08-21 16:26:05	DavidGH	I suggest you run in your debugger and look at the backtrace when it asserts 
2020-08-21 16:26:38	DavidGH	Or, second best, put lots of wxLogDebug statements in the code
2020-08-21 16:26:53	DavidGH	Try to find out what the cursor has to do with the issue
2020-08-21 16:27:14	captainchris	Yes I ran in the debugger,I can execute the two for loop and if the loop finishes te error appears
2020-08-21 16:27:46	DavidGH	And the backtrace...?
2020-08-21 16:28:28	captainchris	How can I do to show backtrace with strace ?? 
2020-08-21 16:28:44	DavidGH	Who mentioned strace?
2020-08-21 16:29:06	captainchris	backtracve is the terminal output ??

2020-08-21 16:49:53	DavidGH	Also, why is there a mismatch between library versions? Do you need to 'make clean' and rebuild?

2020-10-17 17:52:28	captainchris	Hi everybody 
2020-10-17 18:10:58	captainchris	I have a little problem to change wxStaticText value.
2020-10-17 18:13:45	captainchris	https://pastebin.com/gYKTrZ4p the wxStaticText is tileValue. I create wxStaticText *tileValue in gui.hpp. I allocate tileValue with default constructor in my gui constructor (line25)
2020-10-17 18:14:32	captainchris	I Create text in addText with  tileValue->Create(secondPanel,wxID_ANY,"Hello",wxDefaultPosition,wxDefaultSize); (line 64)
2020-10-17 18:15:45	captainchris	And i would like to change value with mousePosition with changeTileValue function (line 85). I tried tileValue->SetLabel("Text"); 
2020-10-17 18:16:17	captainchris	If i change with setLabel in my function addText it is working 
2020-10-17 18:16:29	captainchris	How Can I do 
2020-10-17 18:18:31	captainchris	Here the backtrace https://pastebin.com/WXzgKqbg
2020-10-17 18:21:58	DavidGH	captainchris: Put a breakpoint on line 85, tileValue->SetLabel(wxEmptyString);
2020-10-17 18:21:58	DavidGH	Then run the program. Is the breakpoint hit? Is it hit when it *should* be ;)
2020-10-17 18:24:08	captainchris	yes the breakpoint hit 
2020-10-17 18:24:59	DavidGH	Also, line 169: GUI g(wxT("wxMapEditor"));
2020-10-17 18:24:59	DavidGH	Put a breakpoint on line 170, and check the value of 'g'. Compare it with the value of 'this' in the gui constructor. Are they the same?
2020-10-17 18:25:19	DavidGH	If not, that's your problem.
2020-10-17 18:28:05	DavidGH	I think you'll find it's different
2020-10-17 18:28:05	DavidGH	You probably need to use GetParent() to get a pointer to 'g',  not create a new GUI instance.
2020-10-17 18:45:53	captainchris	Ok i'm trying
2020-10-17 19:04:10	captainchris	https://pastebin.com/sSCQkJzE
2020-10-17 19:04:30	captainchris	p this return the value of drawpanel 
2020-10-17 19:07:45	DavidGH	'p this return the value of drawpanel '  As you would expect.
2020-10-17 19:07:45	DavidGH	For 'g' you may (I get confused by pointers in this sort of situation) need to do: p &g
2020-10-17 19:10:45	DavidGH	But what is the value of p this in the GUI ctor? You could also look at the value of 'p mainPanel' there,
2020-10-17 19:10:45	DavidGH	and later compare it with the value of 'this' at the tileValue->SetLabel breakpoint
2020-10-17 19:11:43	DavidGH	Or, just trust me and use GetParent() instead of creating a new GUI instance. You will need to static_cast it to GUI
2020-10-17 19:17:24	captainchris	ok so to use getParent I need to recreate a wxwindows *win and win->getParent() right ?? 
2020-10-17 19:19:48	DavidGH	But then, when you do 'win.changeTileValue(15); ' it will say that wxWindow doesn't *have* a changeTileValue function
2020-10-17 19:19:56	DavidGH	so you need to cast it to GUI
2020-10-17 19:20:14	DavidGH	bbl
2020-10-17 19:36:47	captainchris	 pWin->(GUI*)changeTileValue(15);   
2020-10-17 19:37:03	captainchris	it says expected primayr expresion ...
2020-10-17 19:37:27	captainchris	I try with static_cast<GUI>changeTileValue it the same 
2020-10-17 20:21:49	DavidGH	captainchris: Try:  (static_cast<GUI>(pWin))->changeTileValue(15); 
2020-10-17 20:24:26	DavidGH	Sorry, that should be: (static_cast<GUI*>(pWin))->changeTileValue(15);
2020-10-17 21:04:19	captainchris	ok compil done but the same problem 
2020-10-17 21:05:22	captainchris	apparently the adress of my new win and gui has the same adress
2020-10-17 21:05:36	captainchris	p this $1 = (GUI * const) 0x55555566c7e0
2020-10-17 21:05:50	captainchris	p pWin $2 = (wxWindow *) 0x55555566c7e0
2020-10-17 21:13:30	DavidGH	The 'new win' is the one you were static_casting; what was the other? Was it in the same method, or in the gui constructor?
2020-10-17 21:18:34	DavidGH	And please pastebin all of your current code, including the header, so that I can run it here
2020-10-17 21:18:43	captainchris	I put it in the drawPanel ctor
2020-10-17 21:18:51	captainchris	ok 
2020-10-17 21:19:06	captainchris	thank for your help David
2020-10-17 21:21:20	captainchris	I paste all my file in gist 
2020-10-17 21:25:52	captainchris	https://gist.github.com/captainchris06210/17a75c4a239905fe9a4f390bb1f9e754
2020-10-17 21:27:17	DavidGH	And gui.hpp ?
2020-10-17 21:27:32	DavidGH	and any other files needed to make it build
2020-10-17 21:29:57	captainchris	All files are in the gist 
2020-10-17 21:31:48	DavidGH	Ah, sorry. I clicked 'raw' and thought that would give me everything
2020-10-17 21:49:22	captainchris	it's tricky
2020-10-17 21:55:30	-->	ferdna (~ferdna@cpe-69-23-148-218.elp.res.rr.com) has joined #wxwidgets
2020-10-17 22:02:38	captainchris	If i call changeTileValue from addText function it is working 
2020-10-17 22:03:11	captainchris	you're right the problem is the transition between gui and drawpanel 
2020-10-17 22:06:51	DavidGH	I seem to be missing main.hpp
2020-10-17 22:08:30	captainchris	https://gist.github.com/captainchris06210/82a6e4b84470a8fefd78d58f73fe6384
2020-10-17 22:08:32	captainchris	sorry 
2020-10-17 22:17:09	DavidGH	I've now got it to build, but there are missing files:  resources/map1.xml etc
2020-10-17 22:18:15	DavidGH	This is why I should have said: "Please create a minimal compilable sample that demonstrates the problem" !
2020-10-17 22:21:23	captainchris	the editor read only the resources/map1.xml
2020-10-17 22:23:02	DavidGH	void GUI::createListCtrl() { img = wxBitmap("resources/levelgridless.png");
2020-10-17 22:23:56	DavidGH	tileset.LoadFile("resources/levelgridless.png");     m.loadXML("resources/map1.xml");
2020-10-17 22:25:04	DavidGH	wxBitmap rect("resources/cursor.png");
2020-10-17 22:30:55	captainchris	I need to recreate the entire project if i need to remove image
2020-10-17 22:33:11	DavidGH	Just pastebin those files, then; or zip them first
2020-10-17 22:33:56	captainchris	ok I zip the project will be  easy to comments lot's of line 
2020-10-17 22:39:05	captainchris	https://ufile.io/sfgyjfxc
2020-10-17 22:55:25	captainchris	you have to uncomment line 167 168
2020-10-17 22:55:34	captainchris	sorry I have commented for a test 
2020-10-17 22:56:33	captainchris	It's very strange. I create a function sayHello in GUI with just an stdd::cout << "Hello wxwidget" << std::endl;
2020-10-17 22:57:10	captainchris	in my mouseEvent I add ((GUI*)GetParent())->sayHello();
2020-10-17 22:57:29	captainchris	and the code print hello ... with error 
2020-10-17 22:57:34	DavidGH	The crash is prevented by doing: wxWindow* parent = GetParent()->GetParent();
2020-10-17 22:57:47	DavidGH	instead of  pWin->GetParent();
2020-10-17 22:58:17	captainchris	I see
2020-10-17 22:58:23	DavidGH	I hadn't noticed that drawPanel's parent was another panel, not the frame
2020-10-17 22:58:44	captainchris	because the parent of drawpanel is borderPanel and not GUI no ??
2020-10-17 22:58:50	DavidGH	Yes
2020-10-17 22:58:53	captainchris	ok 
2020-10-17 23:00:53	captainchris	a big big thank's for your help 
2020-10-17 23:01:38	captainchris	I have a small question for a very good programmer like you 
2020-10-17 23:02:26	DavidGH	NOT like me. I'm just an amateur
2020-10-17 23:02:31	captainchris	I have in my OnPaint function that draw map I show cursor and I need to redrawTile to redrawmap 
2020-10-17 23:02:54	captainchris	there is not a better way to avoir rewrite the same function 
2020-10-17 23:03:00	captainchris	?? 
2020-10-17 23:04:58	DavidGH	I didn't understand that. But the general answer is: create a function that can be called from both places
2020-10-17 23:05:24	DavidGH	Put it in a sensible class e.g. the frame, or the toplevel panel
2020-10-17 23:06:22	captainchris	sorry for my bad english  OnPaint function and redrawTile function 
2020-10-17 23:06:36	captainchris	do the same work
2020-10-17 23:07:15	DavidGH	Yes. As I said ^^
2020-10-17 23:08:01	DavidGH	BTW, now we know that you need to use GetParent()->GetParent(), which is ugly and might change in the future;
2020-10-17 23:08:28	DavidGH	a better way of getting a pointer to the frame class is https://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/group__group__funcmacro__misc.html#ga3a5f33038df32c170c234a0161cfd702
2020-10-17 23:08:41	DavidGH	wxWindow* wxGetTopLevelParent
2020-10-17 23:09:19	DavidGH	Anyway, gtg. Bye
2020-10-17 23:12:02	captainchris	thank's David

2020-12-03 20:42:20	midn	I'm not sure how that would solve the problem. The CallAfter function will warp the pointer, and trigger the mouse handler again, no?
2020-12-03 20:43:53	midn	I need it to be warped the moment the mouse moves to implement arbitrary-distance dragging
2020-12-03 20:43:59	midn	Something akin to grabbing an object in Blender
2020-12-03 20:52:01	DavidGH	I see (I think). So you'd need to reverse what I said:
2020-12-03 20:52:01	DavidGH	Call warp directly from the motion handler, but first set a bool for ignoring the next 'n' motion events.
2020-12-03 20:52:20	DavidGH	Also don't Skip() the events
2020-12-03 20:53:25	midn	This is assuming wxWidgets can't reorder events?
2020-12-03 20:53:29	midn	Okay then, thank you
2020-12-03 20:53:48	DavidGH	No, it can't
2020-12-03 20:54:35	DavidGH	At most, you could override wxApp::FilterEvent and do <whatever> with each relevant event
2020-12-03 20:55:17	DavidGH	but that doesn't offer an obvous way to reorder
2020-12-03 20:55:39	midn	No, that was just a separate question, I was just curious
