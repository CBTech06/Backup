2020-11-25 20:12:29	captainchris	but I can use $(pgrep mpv) works in bash but not in my function

2020-11-25 20:13:02	greycat	so, this "cpulimit" thing isn't an mpv option?
2020-11-25 20:14:54	captainchris	nope cpulimit is an app to reduce cpu usage 
2020-11-25 20:15:14	captainchris	when i wathc movie my cpu usage is up to 150%

2020-11-25 20:17:30	taman	captainchris, right because at that time there is no mpv process for it to report (is my theory).
2020-11-25 20:17:51	captainchris	and how can i do ??
2020-11-25 20:17:53	scrul00se	captainchris: right, because after mpv has finished, there's no mpv process for pgrep to find.  Try single & to background mpv instead of && to wait for exit status, maybe?
2020-11-25 20:18:18	greycat	Why are you using pgrep AT ALL?  Doesn't this cpulimit thing handle it all for you?
